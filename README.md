# Waterless Car Wash: Saving Millions of Liters üåçüöó

**Building AI course project**

---

## Summary

This project calculates the massive water savings achieved by using waterless car washing techniques instead of traditional methods. It quantifies both direct water use and hidden water consumption from chemical production. üå±

---

## Background

Water scarcity is becoming a serious global issue. Traditional car washes use excessive amounts of water ‚Äî about **200 liters per car** ‚Äî and additional water is consumed in the production of chemical cleaning products.

With waterless car washing:
- We **almost eliminate** direct water usage
- We **significantly reduce** indirect water consumption
- We help **preserve natural resources**

My motivation is based on personal experience in waterless car cleaning businesses and the urgent need for sustainable practices in everyday services.

**This project helps to:**
- Show real data on water wastage
- Raise awareness about eco-friendly alternatives
- Promote sustainable business models

---

## How is it used?

The project estimates water savings by:
1. Inputting the number of cars washed per day
2. Inputting the number of working days per year
3. Comparing **traditional car wash** vs. **waterless car wash** water usage
4. Outputting the **total water saved**

This model is useful for:
- Car wash owners and startups
- Environmental researchers
- Anyone promoting sustainable services

## Data sources and AI methods

- Research studies on traditional car wash water usage
- Data from manufacturing reports about chemical product water footprints
- Simple Python-based calculation model
- Potential to expand with machine learning prediction (future work)

| Category                   | Traditional Wash | Waterless Wash |
| --------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------- |
| Direct water per car        | 200 liters        | 0 liters       |
| Water to make chemicals     | 2 liters          | 2 liters       |
| **Total per car**           | **202 liters**    | **2 liters**   |

---

## Challenges

- We assume average water usage; local variations exist.
- Manufacturing processes of chemicals could differ across regions.
- Waterless products may not be available everywhere.
- Ethical communication needed: not all traditional car washes are equally wasteful.

---

## What next?

Future improvements:
- Make a dynamic calculator (web or app)
- Allow regional data input (different water consumption)
- Machine learning prediction for water usage based on car type, weather, dirt level
- Collaborations with sustainable automotive businesses

üîß Needed skills:
- Front-end development (for web version)
- Data science for smarter predictions
- Environmental science consulting

## Example Python Code üìú
```python
def calculate_water_saving(cars_per_day, working_days):
    traditional_water = 202 * cars_per_day * working_days
    waterless_water = 2 * cars_per_day * working_days
    water_saved = traditional_water - waterless_water
    saving_percent = (water_saved / traditional_water) * 100

    print(f"Water used (Traditional): {traditional_water} liters/year")
    print(f"Water used (Waterless): {waterless_water} liters/year")
    print(f"Total Water Saved: {water_saved} liters/year")
    print(f"Saving Percentage: {saving_percent:.2f}%")

# Example: 20 cars/day, 250 working days
calculate_water_saving(20, 250)
